## Credits

The coding boot camp Professional README Guide found at https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide was used as a template for this README. The license was picked from [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).The WHEN/THEN section of this README was based off the project assignment Acceptance Criteria. Most influence was taken from Just-Tech-News of Modules 13 and 14. Stack Overflow, MDN Web Docs, W3, and Google were critical to our success. The website icon was created by BZZRINCANTATION and downloaded from Flaticon.

Some of the bigger improvements to be made include the following:
